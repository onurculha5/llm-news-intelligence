# 🤖 AI Architecture

The platform is completely model-agnostic.

Instead of depending on a single AI provider, every request is routed through a centralized AI Manager.

Supported providers:

| Provider | Role |
|----------|------|
| Google Gemini | Primary |
| Groq (Llama 3.3 70B) | Secondary |
| OpenAI GPT-4.1 Mini | Final fallback |

---

# 🔄 Smart Failover

If one provider becomes unavailable, the next provider automatically continues the analysis.

# 📈 Technical Analysis

Every monitored stock is analyzed using:

- RSI
- MACD
- Bollinger Bands
- ATR
- SMA 20
- SMA 50
- SMA 200

- Volume Analysis
- Daily Price Movement

---

# 📰 AI News Intelligence

Financial news is combined with technical indicators.

The AI evaluates:

- Market sentiment
- Technical trend
- News impact
- Investment risk
- Buy/Sell signal
- Confidence level

Instead of simply summarizing news, the system generates concise investment insights.

# 📲 Notification System

## Instant Mobile Alerts

Watchlist stocks are sent via **Pushover**.

Example:

```text
🟢 NVDA

SIGNAL : BUY

Confidence : High

Positive news combined with an oversold RSI suggests a potential buying opportunity.

Watch : $175 support level
```

## Daily Opportunity Report

The market screener automatically scans the market and sends an email report containing:

- Top opportunities
- AI-generated summaries
- Risk evaluation
- Technical signals
